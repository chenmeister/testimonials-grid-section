## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From this project, I've learned how to set up backgrounds for each card of different colors utilizing the Tailwind CSS approach. Although, I wrote the CSS from scratch, using the approach to add different background colors and text colors allowed for easier code reuse without having to write duplicate CSS code. 

### Continued development

I am hoping to practice more CSS grid without having to depend too much on outside resources. 

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid the Easy Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - Utilizing this YouTube video allowed me to gain some insights on how to approach this problem utilizing the CSS Grid mobile first approach.
